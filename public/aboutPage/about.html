          Welcome to our website, created out of a real need to bring reliable
          and responsible information. <br />
          We invite you to follow, share, and support. Together, we can fight
          the spread of misinformation, which often causes great confusion and
          can even lead to emotional and psychological harm for many people.

            One day, we came across a set of images suspected to depict a
            violent incident in the field, while in reality, it was an old event
            from another country. We saw how easy it is to create a false
            narrative, and how people fall for it emotionally. That's why we
            decided to build a smart platform to instantly verify information
            using an algorithm that cross-checks reliable sources.

            After all, we all want the same thing – to live in a world of truth
            and respectful dialogue. Fake scenarios presented as facts are among
            the biggest threats to our society. Our platform was built to stop
            that.
