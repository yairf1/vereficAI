          Welcome to our website, created out of a real need to bring reliable
          and responsible information.
          <br /><br />
          We invite you to follow, share, and support. Together, we can fight
          the spread of misinformation, which causes confusion and emotional
          harm.

            One day, we came across a set of images suspected to depict a
            violent incident in the field, while in reality, it was an old event
            from another country. We saw how easy it is to create a false
            narrative, and how people fall for it emotionally. That's why we
            decided to build a smart platform to instantly verify information
            using an algorithm that cross-checks reliable sources.

            After all, we all want the same thing – to live in a world of truth
            and respectful dialogue. Fake scenarios presented as facts are among
            the biggest threats to our society. Our platform was built to stop
            that.
